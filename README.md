# php-chat-room
This is a chat room programmed in PHP. Feel free to look at the source code or you can put it on your server. No databases needed to install on your server.

# Installation instructions
To install this, you will need a web server, and you need to install PHP 7.0 or 7.1. You do not have to configure the databases.

# Live Demo
You can use a live demo on my onion site (requires Tor) at http://hu4pipih5ngipm2p.onion/chat/.
